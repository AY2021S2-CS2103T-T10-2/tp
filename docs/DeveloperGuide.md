## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-task 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `PlannerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("rmt 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `rmt 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the planner data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` and `ObservableList<Tag>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableCalendarDate` for the calendar to observe.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the planner data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Enforcing conditions

When executing commands, the planner has to enforce certain logical constraints to prevent unintended command behaviour.
Here is a list of constraints:
 * A task should not have a duration attribute without a date or recurring schedule attribute.
 * A task should not have an empty title.
 * A task should have a title with at most 40 characters.

Note that certain constraints may be relevant to specific commands. For instance (this list is not exhaustive):
 * Checking if the date attribute is empty for commands like `count` which counts down the days from today's date
 * The index specified by the user for commands that require a INDEX parameter,
  should be positive and within the range of the list of displayed tasks.
 
#### Design considerations
##### Bad designs not chosen:
While the task is a composition of the various attributes like: title, status, etc, there is a violation of the Single
Responsibility Principle when the Task class is checking for whether the date of a task object has passed today's date,
or checking if the change in a date is valid.

In addition, checking the constraints in each of the command's execute method (which is the case in v1.2, and some
commands in v1.3) violates the Don't Repeat Yourself principle. As shown in the list of constraints above, there are
many repeated constraints which will be checked across different commands. This also violates the Dependency Inversion
principle when the command's execute method depends on methods from lower level classes such as Date.

##### Chosen design:
Therefore, enforcing conditions has been implemented as shown in the class diagram below.
![ConditionClassDiagram](images/ConditionClassDiagram.png)

1. When a XYZCommand runs the execute method, it might call the ConditionLogic class. This acts as the main facade
class.
2. ConditionLogic will then call the relevant condition or constraint manager class.
3. The relevant classes will then create an AttributeManager object to access the functionalities provided by 
each of the attribute classes.

From point 2, the choice to split the ConditionLogic class into secondary facade classes: ConstraintManager,
IndexManager, DateVerifier, RecurringScheduleVerifier, is to ensure that single responsibility principle is upheld.

From point 3, the various secondary facade classes could directly access the attribute classes. However, that would
violate the Law of Demeter, hence the AttributeManager class provides access to the functionalities of the attributes.

The separation of attributes and conditions into their own packages increases cohesion and allows for the future
creation of commands to reuse the code when enforcing conditions.

### Mark task as done

A task has a Status attribute which can be marked as done, using the Done command.

  * The Status attribute is a data field belonging to Task, and only has 2 valid values: 'done' and 'not done'.
  * The doneCommand only takes in a single parameter, INDEX, which must be a valid positive integer.

The following activity diagram illustrates how a user might utilise this feature:

![DoneCommandActivityDiagram](images/DoneCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram has been simplified to show the main processes called during the execution of
DoneCommand.

![DoneSequenceDiagram](images/DoneSequenceDiagram.png)

As seen from the sequence diagram above, the Done Command makes use of the setTask() function to update the model
since this process is equivalent to updating the status attribute from 'not done' to 'done'. This abides by the DRY
principle to avoid writing functions with similar logical processes.


### Find matching task using keyword(s)

The `find` command is applicable to **all tasks** within PlanIT. There are 3 different methods of `find` implementations:
1. Find by title : Find all matching task(s) using any matching full keyword(s) from title of task using `find [KEYWORDS]`
2. First by tag : Find all matching task(s) with exact matching full keyword(s) from tag(s) of task using `find t/[TAG]`
   Only this method can be used to search matching task(s) with full keyword(s) from multiple tags like `find t/ t/`
3. Find by description : Find all matching task(s) using any matching full keyword(s) from description of task using `find d/[DESCRIPTION]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** All 3 methods cannot be mixed with each other.</div>

Below is an activity diagram of the above 3 methods which illustrates the general process applicable for the 3 different find implementation queries.

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

Below is also an example of the default method of find by title general process description followed by the sequence diagram illustration.

##### Find by title
1. `FindCommandParser` will parses the keywords to `TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
2. `TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate` will be generated and a predicate value will be returned to `FindCommandParser`.
3. `FindCommandParser` will send the predicate value to `FindCommand`.
4. `FindCommand` will be generated and returns the command to the `FindCommandParser`.
5. `FindCommand` will call `execute(model)` function and it will pass predicate value into the `Model` through `updateFilteredTaskList`.
6. `filteredTasks` list will be updated accordingly in `ModelManager` and the filtered list display in PlanIT will be updated.
7. `CommandResult` will eventually be returned and feedback will be given to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**For find by tag and find by description,
the steps are similar except for step 3 and 4 where it will be TagContainsKeywordsPredicate and
DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate 
respectively in place of TitleContainsKeywordsPredicate </div>

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindByTitleSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Considerations
For the `find` command, there are 2 design choices being considered in whether to split the 3 implementation methods
like `findTag`, `findTitle`, `findDescription`  into three different commands separately 
or just use a single command `find` in addition with command line prefix to perform 3 different implementations. 

1. **Current design**: Having a single command `find` to perform 3 different implementations.

    - Advantages:
        - From the user point of view, they do not have to remember extra commands since there are a lot of commands
          within PlanIT and it is quite intuitive to remember the command line prefix like `t/` `d/`
          since these prefix will be used for most commands in the PlanIT.
        - The problem of duplicate codes will be minimised since the general process from FindCommandParser -> 
          FindCommand to Model and CommandResult are similar for the 3 different methods. The place where they differ
          is only from FindCommandParser to TitleContainsKeyWordsPredicate, FindCommandParser 
          to DescriptionContainsKeywordsPredicate and FindCommandParser to TagContainsKeywordsPredicate respectively.
          
    - Disadvantages:
        - The code will be cluttered in a FindCommandParser for the 3 different implementation methods.


2. **Alternative design**: Having 3 different commands `findTag`, `findTitle`, `findDescription`
   to perform 3 different implementations.

    - Advantages:
        - Code will be segregated out and parser for each implementation will not be so complex.

    - Disadvantages:
        - There is a need to use 3 parser and 3 commands in code implementation which increase the likelihood of code
          duplication.
        - Since there are more commands for the user to remember, it is highly likely for the user to
          keep referring to the user guide if the user keeps forgetting the various commands.

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortByDateSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 4. Sorting tasks

The `Sort` command applies to tasks in List. Both `sort by a` and the `sort by d`
follow similar implementations with slight differences. Below we will look into the implementation of 
the `sort by a`.

The `sort by a` feature sorts the tasks based on the different dates of the tasks from the earliest task
to the last task in chronological order. For tasks with no dates, they would appear last.
1. When the command is executed by the user, the input it passed into
   the `LogicManager` and gets parsed and identified in `AddressBookParser`.
2. Upon identifying the relevant `COMMAND_WORD` and by extension the `ENTITY` (through the `-` input)
   , the corresponding `SortCommandParser` object is formed. The user input then goes
   through another level of parsing in `SortCommandParser`
3. The `SortCommandParser` identifies the order in which the tasks are to be sort and creates a
   `SortComparator` comparator object accordingly.
4. The ```SortCommandParser``` creates a ```SortCommand``` with the above comparator. The command
   is returned to the ```LogicManager```.
5. The ```LogicManager``` calls ```SortCommand#execute()```, which adds a new duplicate list of tasks that is
   sorted in chronological order in ```List``` via the ```Model``` interface.
6. Finally, a ```CommandResult``` with the relevant feedback is returned to the ```LogicManager```.

##### Design Considerations
For the `SortCommand`, we had several considerations that we made on whether to sort the list manually through
the `sort` command or to automatically sort the list for every task that is added or edited.

1. Alternative 1 (current choice): User has the option to sort the list manually in both ascending and descending format.
   The list will not be automatically sorted when a task has been added or changed.

    - Pros:
        - If the user types in wrong information for a certain task, he is able to see the task at the bottom rather
          than filtering through a sorted list which makes it easier to fix the error that he has made.
        - Code will be easier to implement as we so not need to implement the auto sort phase.

    - Cons:
        - User has to manually sort the list, using the `sort` command, after keying in the new tasks to obtain an
          ordered list.

2. Alternative 2: The list will be automatically sorted every time the user makes a new list or edits one.

    - Pros:
        - Tasks will always be in chronological order and user does not have to key in any command to sort the list.

    - Cons:
        - If the user adds in a task with wrong details to a huge list, it will be difficult to find the task.
          If the previous method was used the new task added will be at the bottom of the list.
        - The code will be much more complex compared to alternative 1.
        - User will not be have the ability to sort the list in different orders.



### Removing a field from a task

A task in the planner's task list can contain multiple fields. Some of these fields can be removed without deleting
the entire task, while other fields are compulsory and cannot be removed. 
- Removable fields: `Date`, `RecurringSchedule`, `Description`, `Tags`, `Duration`
- Non-removable fields: `Title`, `Status`

An example of how a user might use this command is shown in the activity diagram below.

![DeleteFieldActivityDiagram](images/DeleteFieldActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete field command works internally.

![DeleteFieldSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteFieldSequenceDiagram.png)

Something noteworthy would be the fact that `Duration` cannot exist alone and must exist with either `Date` OR `RecurringSchedule`.
As this approach creates a new task with the same attributes and replaces it with the existing task in the planner, when a user tries
to remove the `Date`/`RecurringSchedule` field without removing the `Duration` first, an error will be thrown. 

####Aspect: How removing a task executes

####Alternatives 1 (current choice): Remove field by setting it to an empty string.  

This approach was chosen as it is easy to implement, and not too much of refactoring of code is needed.

####Alternatives 2: Remove field by setting it to null. 

This approach was not chosen as it would require more refactoring of code - if anything is missed out, 
it will result in undesirable runtime exceptions.

### Viewing list of tags in the tags panel

Each task may be associated with 0 or more tags that are stored in the `UniqueTagList`. The `UniqueTagList` ensures that
no 2 tags are duplicate in the program at 1 time, emphasizing the abstraction of tags as an Object.

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

The `UniqueTagList` then exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tag>` to be observed by the `UI`, much like how the
list of tasks is being observed by the `UI`. This tag list is presented visually using `TagListPanel` in `UI`. Below is
an activity diagram illustrating how a command will trigger a change in the `UniqueTagList`, in continuation from the
delete command activity diagram in the
[`Logic`](#logic-component) section:

![UniqueTagListSequenceDiagram](images/UniqueTagListSequenceDiagram.png)

The `UniqueTagList` class encapsulates the data and related behavior of a unique tag list, which removes the given tag
from its internal list in the diagram above. The `ModelManager` provides access to the list for the `UI` as shown
below:

![UniqueTagListSequenceDiagram2](images/UniqueTagListSequenceDiagram2.png)

As seen, there is a clear separation of responsibilities between the `UI`, `Logic` and `Model`, which complies with
the Observer pattern where the view in `UI` communicates with the `UniqueTagList` in `Model` through an
interface, subscribing to the changes in the list. Thus, coupling is reduced.
This interface is actually `<<Logic>>` and `<<Model>>`, implemented by `LogicManager` and `ModelManager`, which are
abstracted out of the diagram for more concrete representation.

### Viewing tasks on a date and changing the calendar's date

The `view` command can get and list all tasks with dates and their recurring schedule's dates on a particular date. The
next argument for the command is taken as the `DATE` and used in the predicate that filters the task list stored. The
resulting filtered task list is displayed on the `TaskListPanel` in the app. The following activity diagram illustrates
the workflow when a user uses the `view` command:

![ViewDateActivityDiagram](images/ViewDateActivityDiagram.png)

The given date argument is used in `TaskOnDatePredicate` which is an aggregation of 2 other predicates:
`TaskDateOnDatePredicate` and `TaskScheduledOnDatePredicate`. The sequence diagram below shows how the command is parsed
and executed:

![ViewDateSequenceDiagram](images/ViewDateSequenceDiagram.png)

Updating the filtered task list causes a change in the `ObservableTaskList` encapsulated in a `UniqueTaskList`, in turn
encapsulated within the model and planner. The `ObservableTaskList` then propagates the changes to the `TaskListPanel`
to be viewed.

#### Changing the calendar's viewing date

The date given in the view command is also used to update the calendar. This is implemented as an `Observable` object
called `ObservableCalendarDate`, stored within the model encapsulated by the planner. It is passed to the
`CalendarPanel` upon instantiation in the `MainWindow` view. The `CalendarPanel` implements an `Observer` interface,
which subscribes to the `Observable` for notifications whenever there is a change in date caused by the `view` command.

![ObservableCalendarDateDiagram](images/ObservableCalendarDateClassDiagram.png)

Thus, `CalendarPanel` and `ObservableCalendarDate` conforms to the observer pattern, reducing coupling.
